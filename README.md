This is a set of STB-style header-only libraries for doing various things in C.

* `str.h`: string manipulation beyond what the standard library provides.
* `test.h`: the essentials of automated testing.

The details of each library can be found in the comments at the top of each
source code file. The `tests` folder is reserved for automated testing using
`test.h`.
